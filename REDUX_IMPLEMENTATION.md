# Redux Implementation for Employee Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the Redux implementation for the Employee Management System, replacing the previous Context API approach with a more scalable state management solution.

## Architecture

### Store Structure
```
src/store/
├── index.ts                 # Main store configuration
├── hooks.ts                 # Typed Redux hooks
└── slices/
    ├── authSlice.ts         # Authentication state management
    └── employeeSlice.ts     # Employee data state management
```

### Actions Structure
```
src/actions/
├── authActions.ts           # Authentication API calls
└── employeeActions.ts       # Employee API calls
```

## Key Features

### 1. Redux Toolkit Integration
- Uses `@reduxjs/toolkit` for modern Redux development
- Includes `createSlice` for reducer logic
- Implements `createAsyncThunk` for async operations

### 2. TypeScript Support
- Fully typed Redux store and actions
- Custom hooks for type-safe state access
- Proper error handling with typed error states

### 3. API Integration
- Centralized API calls using Axios instances
- Automatic token injection for authenticated requests
- Response interceptors for error handling

### 4. State Management

#### Auth State
- User authentication status
- User profile data
- Loading and error states
- Automatic token management

#### Employee State
- Employee list with pagination
- Search and filtering capabilities
- CRUD operations for employees
- Loading and error states

## Usage Examples

### Using Redux in Components
```typescript
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks';
import { fetchEmployees, createEmployee } from '../store/slices/employeeSlice';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const { employees, loading, error } = useAppSelector(state => state.employees);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchEmployees({ page: 1, limit: 10 }));
  }, [dispatch]);

  const handleCreateEmployee = (employeeData) => {
    dispatch(createEmployee(employeeData));
  };

  return (
    // Component JSX
  );
};
```

### API Calls
```typescript
import { employeeAPI } from '../actions/employeeActions';

// Get employees
const employees = await employeeAPI.getEmployees({ page: 1, limit: 10 });

// Create employee
const newEmployee = await employeeAPI.createEmployee(employeeData);

// Update employee
const updatedEmployee = await employeeAPI.updateEmployee(id, employeeData);
```

## Backend Updates

### Enhanced User Model
The User model has been updated to support comprehensive employee data:
- Personal information (employeeId, DOB, gender, etc.)
- Contact details (phone, address, emergency contacts)
- Statutory information (PAN, Aadhaar, passport)
- Bank details
- Education history
- Work experience
- Employment details
- Document management

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/employees` - Get all employees with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/employees/:id` - Get employee by ID
- `POST /api/employees` - Create new employee
- `PUT /api/employees/:id` - Update employee
- `DELETE /api/employees/:id` - Delete employee

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Redux provides a predictable state management pattern
2. **Developer Experience**: Redux DevTools for debugging
3. **Performance**: Optimized re-renders with proper selectors
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized state logic and actions
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout

## Migration from Context API

The migration from Context API to Redux includes:
- Replaced `AuthContext` with Redux auth slice
- Updated all components to use Redux hooks
- Centralized API calls in action files
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistence**: Add Redux Persist for state persistence
2. **Caching**: Implement data caching strategies
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Add optimistic UI updates
4. **Real-time Updates**: Integrate WebSocket for real-time data
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering options
